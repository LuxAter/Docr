# Sections #

Text that can be split into paragraphs, based on if there is a blank line
between character groups.

## Sub Sections ##

- Bulleted lists
- That are able to handel sub lists, or multiple paragraphs for every entry
    based on the preceading whitespace.
    1. Numbered lists
    2. That are automatically enumerated.

Some ability to do **Bold** text and *italic* or _italic_ text would be good,
aswell as combinations of the two. Also lets add in `inline` code, and $math$.
there is always some fun in having math workng. Then there sould also be outof
line

```cpp
#include <iostream>
```

code that can be based on the laguages specivied. Aswll as outof line math
$$math equations and stuff$$.

$$$
Here is some inline math!

\frac{2b}{4c} = 92

In the future I would like to implement definition lists symbolized by adding a
colon to the end of a line, and the following indented lines are the
definition.

Definition:
    This is some example of what a definition might look like. Where it begins
    by the title, then a colon, followed by the definition in subsequent lines.

    Here I want to test multi-paragraph definitions. Will it work? I doubt it.

Everything sould be nestable, so that anything can have anything else nested
within it.

!!! Warning
    I would also like to implement the use of Admonitons. These must be
    specified by `!!!`, and must be the first thing in the line. Then followed
    by an optional title. On subsequent lines will be the content.

    This should also now have the ability to be multiple paragraphs.
