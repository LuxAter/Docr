# Sections #

Text that can be split into paragraphs, based on if there is a blank line
between character groups.

## Sub Sections ##

- Bulleted lists
- That are able to handel sub lists, or multiple paragraphs for every entry
    based on the preceading whitespace.
    1. Numbered lists
    2. That are automatically enumerated.

Some ability to do **Bold** text and *italic* or _italic_ text would be good,
aswell as combinations of the two. Also lets add in `inline` code, and $math$.
there is always some fun in having math workng. Then there sould also be outof
line

```cpp
#include <iostream>
```

code that can be based on the laguages specivied. Aswll as outof line math
$$math equations and stuff$$.

In the future I would like to implement definition lists symbolized by adding a
colon to the end of a line, and the following indented lines are the
definition.

Everything sould be nestable, so that anything can have anything else nested
within it.
