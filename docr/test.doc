This is a sample text file. It sould just include text, and nothing else. If
It includes anything other than one text object we have an issue.

Lets try with a second paragraph. Will this still work? What if we start
adding new things... Like Code! `This is inline code!` Followed by some more text.

Lets try adding some more complex things like *Bold text _with italic inside it _ Followed by more bold*. How did that all work?? $This is inline math$

$$\frac{2\pi}{4}$$

- This is a list
- Still part of the list
- Final entry
- Mabye we can try a sub list?
  - First sub list
  - Second??

That was cool! Now lets try some enumeration...

1) This is the first
2) This is the second
3) THis is the third
10) This is some more text!!

Maby we can do roman??? NO! that seems hard

# How about a title? #
And now some text to fill in the following paragraph!

## What about a sub title ##
